	    Religion affects how people live their lives. It can affect things ranging from diet to (the extreme) case of sleep deprivation. Religious practices are wide and varied. For example, Christians are monotheistic while Hindus worship a variety of gods, such as Lakshimi, the goddess of wealth and beauty. Muslims are forbidden from certain foods, and certain Catholics pray to saints.

	    Muslims believe that ‘there is no disease that Allah created, except that He also created its remedy.’ Muslims strongly believe that every disease in the world was created with a cure to it. Living in Guangzhou, China, despite being in an international school, there aren’t a lot of Muslims in our midst. However, we did manage to find two, and we asked their opinion on this line of the Quran:
    </p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
	    Dina – Everything happens for a reason, there are things that are curable and sometimes things just happen and you can’t do anything about it and Muslims learn to accept that and move on.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
	    Agatha - (This is) Part of the natural order because in Islam and most religions judgment day will come and it’s inevitable
    </blockquote>

	    Jehovah’s Witnesses, despite the possible need for blood transfusions deny them as ‘the Bible forbids taking blood in to sustain the body.’ However, as long as health practices do not conflict with the Bible they are open to anything. Jehovah’s Witnesses also abstain from smoking and drugs as this strongly violates their beliefs, however, drinking is allowed as long as they do not get drunk. These practices end up benefiting Jehovah’s Witnesses in the long term.

	    When conducting our survey, we asked how they were treated for the common cold. In the west, people commonly drink chicken soup for a cold, as it keeps on hydrated and reduces inflammation. Most people in Asia/of Asian descent stated they did not see the point of eating chicken soup and said they would sleep it off instead. If that wasn’t enough, they would use western medicine.
