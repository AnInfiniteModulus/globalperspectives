    <p class="paragraph-container">Depending of the strength of the belief, religion deeply affects the way in which people live their day-to-day life. It can affect your dietary requirements, when you eat, in extreme cases your beliefs can actually lead you to deprive yourself of sleep [1]! There are many differences between the ways in which different religions work, for example people who practice Hinduism worship many gods that are representative of many different aspects of life, such as Lakshmi who is the goddess of wealth and beauty [2], which results in their being many diverse traditions. Muslims cannot eat certain things because it goes against their religion. Devote Christians have different saints they pray to for different problems or if they are in search of a solution.

Starting with Muslims, this perhaps is one of the more extreme examples. As they believe that ‘there is no disease that Allah created, except that He also created its remedy. [3]’ In simple terms, Muslims strongly believe that every single disease in the world was created with a cure to it. Living in Guangzhou, China, being in an international school, we don’t have a lot of Muslims in our midst, however we did manage to find two, to ask them what their views were on the line in the Quran. [4]

      <b>Dina - Everything happens for a reason, there are things that are curable and sometimes things just happen and you can’t do anything about it and Muslims learn to accept that and live on.

    <p class="paragraph-container">One different religion that affects the health practices deeply is Jehovah’s Witness. Jehovah’s Witnesses are defined as people that teach about Jehovah (god.) When in need of a blood transfusion they are denied as they believe that [5] ‘the Bible forbids taking blood in to sustain the body.’ However as long as said health practices do not conflict with the Bible they are open to any medical attention they can accumulate. [6] They also abstain from smoking and drugs as this goes heavily against their beliefs, however drinking is allowed as long as they do not get drunk. In the long term this ends up benefitting them (Jehovah’s witnesses) as a whole, as they avoid these bad influences all together. </p>
