    <p class="paragraph-container">As our question is based on healthcare, it was consequential for us to reach out to doctors close to us to include into our primary research. We contacted Doctor David Tai who works in the Euram clinic, Guangzhou. The foreigners in Guangzhou are the main customers as it is a western private company. Below is the survey I created along with the doctor’s response:

In summation, I think that it is evident from questions two and six that this doctor is diligent in using western methods when it comes to practice, as the majority of his training and work experience was in clinics following western protocols. It is apparent that technology has remoulded the world of healthcare as many doctors such as Dr. Tai have embedded the use of technology into their practices, helping them detect different medical issues quickly, efficiently and most of the time accurately as well. Medical technology has played a crucial role in prolonging health as well as aiding doctor’s practices and diagnosis’. Examples of this would be MRI machines, robotic prosthetic limbs and artificial organs. The amount technology has alleviated healthcare is extremely astonishing as it has unlocked a door to a whole new dimension. The answer to question eight proves this because it shows how doctors are open to incorporating technology in their practices and research. To people nowadays this may not seem as one of the greatest discoveries however, video calls and telecommunication has helped people greatly worldwide as money is saved and information can be sent almost instantaneously. Surgeries have advanced to such an extent and this is evident, as robotic surgeries now exist. This means that, physicians and surgeons are able to operate this robot from any location without having to physically do the operation themselves. In regards to the question of research, scientists are able to examine different diseases and infections on a cellular level. According to the world health organization, vaccines save about 3 million lives per year and prevent millions from undertaking deadly viruses and diseases, exemplifying how significant technology has truly been; it is this research that helped doctors create vaccines.
<br>
<br>
Yes, technology has greatly improved doctors’ health practices. However, technology has helped patients to a great extent as well. This is apparent as the Pew Internet and American Life Project stated that in 2004, 66% of a survey of 8 million seniors who use the Internet say that they use the Internet for healthcare information and in 2009, 24 million Americans said the exact same. This highlights how useful technology truly is as some may not be able to afford medical healthcare and have to rely on the doctors they find online. From superficial diseases to immedicable diseases, seeing an online doctor is an advantage to many.

	     As a group, encountering new forms of medical treatment has been a cultural shock – allowing us to broaden our horizons and integrate new practices in our lives. However, one continuous trend our group has noticed is the predominance of Western practices. As the technological forefront of the world, we notice that medical practices continue to be driven by Western research and technology, as evidenced by our responses from our doctor.
One of our group’s members, Andrew, began to rely less on Western medicine, seeing that TCM allows for preventative treatment and reduced the dangers of reliance on painkillers (he has chronic migraines). On the flip side, another member, Bianca, continues to use predominantly western medicine. However, our group concludes that in severe situations, Western medicine continues to prove itself to be the superior choice, and in the future, the world will follow Western medical practices more and more.
