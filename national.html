    <p class="paragraph-container">Even though Japan is the most technologically advanced country in the world today, the United States of America still remains the most advanced country in medicine. Technology plays a role in creating machines and tools to help modify a doctor’s practice; the USA is the largest medical device market in the world (market size of 100 billion us dollars.)</p>

    <p class="paragraph-container">The chart above compares the USA’s medical technology to an LEDC’s such as Israel. As you can see, the gap between the two countries is shockingly large, exemplifying how not all countries are able to gain access to working and effective healthcare. </p>

	    At the root of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), there is the existence of a belief. Individual human bodies are integral parts that revolve around the forces of nature. Chinese consider the body as a system that requires a balance of yin and yang energy to maintain good health and function properly. Instead of ones organs being interdependent on other organs, each organ is viewed as independent, therefore, requiring a balance of yin and yang energy. This balance is able to strengthen the immune system and increase resistibility to diseases. As a balance in the body is completely necessary, Chinese medicine is able to tackle illnesses by identifying these unbalances prior to its development into a disease/illness. In China careful and regular observations of the body is a necessity as well, in order to stay healthy. Chinese believe that the consumption of herbs, acupuncture and different diets are able to free energy from the patient, which than can be used as a supply of yin and yang energy, this halts the development of a disease or illness and brings health back to the human body.

	    Your diets play a major role in Chinese medical treatments, regarding colds and flus. It is believed to leave a significant affect in altering the body’s ‘climate’. It is fairly straightforward when it comes to identifying the differences between yin foods and yang foods: yin foods tend to be more bitter and salty flavored whilst yang food are more pungent and thick. The table below shows an indication of how different foods and nutrients affect the temperature within the body. By increasing the yin energy into the human body through diets, internal tension can be cooled and vice-versa, by increasing yang energy into the body, internal tension will be warmed. Research has shown that when people consume an excess of yin, they may have symptoms of being sluggish, emotionally sensitive and unwilling to remain active during work, whilst when an excess of yang has been ingested, people tend to be more tense and aggressive. Ingestions are therefore extremely crucial as there must be a balance between the two energy- yin and yang to maintain the neutral/optimum temperature for the enzymes in the body to function at its best thus maintaining health by deflecting bacterial and fungi infections.

	    Another important way to treat colds and flus using Chinese medicine is through herbs. Chinese doctors often refer to their major uses prior giving consent forms of medicine to patients to provide the best cure possible that will allow healing as soon as possible.

    <p class="paragraph-container">
	    However, in recent years, scientific research has shown that TCM is not very effective when it comes to flus and colds, as there are no scientific based treatments and diagnoses. To this day it remains a controversial subject.
